//SUM OF DIGITS (2)

//The program reads a basis for numeration and several numbers and prints the
//sum in base 10 of the digits in base b of each one.

//Input consists of the value of bâ‰¥ 2 followed by a sequence of natural
//numbers.
//Output: For every number, print the sum (in base 10) of its digits in base b
//following the format of the examples.
