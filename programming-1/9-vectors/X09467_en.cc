//RAMPS

//Write a program indicating the positions with a ramp and the number of pairs
//(i,j) with i<j corresponding to positions with a ramp and potentially
//conflictive.

//The input is formed by a non-empty sequence of cases. Each case is described
//by an integer nâ‰¥ 3 followed by the n integer values of the corresponding
//vector.
//Output: Print, for each case, the positions having a ramp and the number of
//pairs of positions (i,j) with i<j having a ramp and potentially conflictive.
