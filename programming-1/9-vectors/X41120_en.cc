//VECTOR OF MOUNTAINS

//Write a program that, given a mountainous profile represented by a vector,
//calculates the number of peaks and which of these peaks are higher than the
//last visited peak of the hike.

//The input is formed by a natural n â‰¥ 3 indicating the number of points in
//the mountainous profile. Following, there are the n heights registred at
//those points. The heights are integer numbers.
//Output: Indicate the total number of mountain peaks for the profile
//described in the input, and their height. Then print the height of those
//peaks that are higher than the last peak in the described profile. The
//cases of a profile not having any peak, or not having peaks higher than the
//last one, should be noted conveniently.
