//Write a program that reads a list with the given presents, and prints the 
//sorted list of the teachers, from best to worst. 

//Input consists of a natural n followed by an empty line and of n cases, 
//separated by lines in white. Each case consists of a natural t â‰¥ 1 that 
//indicates the number of teachers. t lines follow, each one with the name of 
//the teacher, the number of given sweets, and the number of given carrots. 
//All the names of the same case are different.
//Output: For each case, print the sorted list of the teachers, from best to 
//worst. It must print each name in a different line, and an empty line at 
//the end of each case.
